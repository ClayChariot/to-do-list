Due to fact I work with a clients in an archive of a huge government institution,procedures I use in my daily work activites consists mostly of using a lot of inputs in order to find certain
data. That means I have to be well-aware of all of kind of potential typing errors in databases, therefore,I have chosen to make this "To-do list" project as much as user-friendly as possible.
Features I implemented are:

1) Invalid task inputs are: empty string,multiplied empty spacess,task consisted only of special characters (rubbish)
2) Input text is trimmed both at the beginning and at the end and also all kind of multiple spaces in the middle are stripped down to only one space between words.
3) Task can be added with or without a date,and cannot be added with time if no date is set.
4) Date is displayed in a format common to my native country Serbia and is display with a name of day in the week.
5) To-do list is sorted in such order that general tasks without date and time are first shown (daily routines like drinking pills,praying,etc.)
All the rest are sorted in date and time order,also those containing only date come before those with the same date but with a specified time.
6) The same task already added cannot be added again,so repeating is prevented.
7) Local Storage is implemented.
8) All kinds of error messages are shown below input field.

I hope you will all find it useful and fun at the same time!
Cheers!
